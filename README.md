Serve this folder with any static HTTP server, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

## Add the teaser later

1. Put the vertical 9:16 video in `assets/teaser.mp4`.
2. Set `TEASER_VIDEO_URL` in `script.js` to `'assets/teaser.mp4'`.

The custom player enables playback, seeking, mute, and fullscreen once the video source is set. The Register button goes to the club website's contact section.
